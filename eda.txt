--Data Set Description 
This data set is data about a region called Vienna, which is the capital of the Republic of Austria and its largest city.
 It is located in the central-eastern region of the country, on the banks of the Danube River.
This data set describes to us the guests who visited this area in early 2023 in terms of their names, the length of their stay,
the prices they paid for their stay, in addition to the names and types of rooms, longitude and latitude,
the number of reviews on these rooms, in addition to the name of the neighborhood and the availability of rooms during the year.

--based on previous calculation i find 6 colmn which contains missing value I will deal with missing values ​​in more than one way
--In the beginning we have two empty columns that do not contain any values, as we do not need them license  ,neighbourhood_group 
I will delete them first -->After deleted them (still 4 colmn contains missing values )
--After using this way( Drop missing values5% or less of total values) -->host_name colmn doesnot contains missing value (still 3 colmn contains missing values)
--After Applay Impute by sub-group (room_type have different median price)-->price dosenot contains any missing value (still 2 colmn have missing values)
--After applay this way (This function fills the null values ​​(NaN) in the column using the previous non-empty value. This means that if there is an empty cell in the "last_review" column, this function will fill it using the value in the previous row) on last_review colmn -->last_review dosenot contains any missing value (still one colmn contains missing value )
---After Applay Impute by sub-group (The monthly review may be affected by several factors, including Type room)-->This means that month_review doesnot contains any missing value -->there 0 colmn contains Missing value 

*****************************************we finish part related to Deal with Missing Value *********************************************
1)First Figure is barplot -->The insights from the figure is Hotel rooms are the most expensive among other rooms,
 but shared rooms are the least expensive.
2)Seconed Figure is scatterplot -->The  idea from figure : the more the number of reviews per month increases,
 the more the total number of reviews increases.
3)Third Figure is  barplot --> Private rooms are the least available during the year .
4)Fourth Figure is barplot -->There are 1 neighbourhood, It is one of the neighborhoods with the lowest availability rate during the year
 'Josefstadt'
After representing the previous four forms, we can come up with a decision as follows:
I suggest creating a number of private rooms (because they are more expensive than others, such as shared rooms, 
for example, but they are less available) in the  neighborhoods('Josefstadt') that contain the least Number of  rooms.

--5)fifth figure is barplot -->How are the numbers of reviews distributed across different neighborhoods? 
Are there neighborhoods that attract more reviews? 
In this graph, the number of reviews will be displayed on the vertical axis and neighborhood names on the horizontal axis.
We notice from the drawing that the number of shelves varies depending on the neighborhood,
 as there are neighborhoods that have large numbers of shelves compared to others.
 This is evidence that the shelf is affected by the name of the neighborhood.
--6)الشكل الناتج هو "مخطط الانحدار الخطي" (Linear Regression Plot)
We notice from the previous figure that the relationship between the number of reviews and prices is 
an inverse relationship. The lower the price, the greater the number of reviews, 
because it will increase the number of people visiting the place. 
Therefore, I suggest making discounts on prices on some occasions and seasons to increase the number 
of reviews and increase 
the number of people visiting the place (a type of marketing the place) 

---7)هذا الرسم البياني يُعرف عمومًا باسم "رسم الانحدار الخطي المتعدد" (Multiple Linear Regression Plot )
We notice from the figure that prices rise very high at a certain location (certain latitude and longitude lines).
latitude(48.200)to (48.225)
longitude(16.35)to(16.40)
Therefore, these are the appropriate areas for investment and construction of residential units,
 so anyone who wants to invest his money in this area must invest in these points specifically.
